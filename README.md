# 🌍 AGON Labs — The Future of Carbon Markets & DeFi  
**Tokenizing Carbon Credits for On-Chain Climate Impact**  
*September 2025*

> *Join the future of finance and climate impact.*  
> *Be part of the most advanced carbon-native DeFi ecosystem.*

---

## 🧩 1. The Problem
The **Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM)** today is:
- Fragmented, illiquid, and opaque  
- Lacking standardized on-chain units usable in DeFi  
- Missing transparent price signals and verifiable impact data  

Without better liquidity, data, and trust, carbon finance cannot scale to the levels needed for real climate action.

---

## 💡 2. The Solution
**AGON Labs** builds a unified, on-chain carbon finance infrastructure combining:
- 🔹 **Tokens backed by high-quality carbon credits** — enabling liquidity and risk management  
- 🔹 **DeFi-enabled Options Vaults (DOVs)** — structured yield deployment mechanisms  
- 🔹 **Transparent registry and redemption layer** — on-chain verification of issuance and retirement  
- 🔹 **Carbon floor mechanisms** — for use of carbon assets as DeFi collateral
